openscad-demos
==============

I love OpenSCAD and I'm unashamed!


What is OpenSCAD?
==============
OpenSCAD is an alternative to other CAD programs that allows you to make your
designs in terms of a script.  You define the geometry and it's rendered.
There's a very minimal user interface.  I love it!

Why does this repo exist?
==============
I'm currently making some stuff: a Yahtzee cup to go along with the 5 6-sided
dice that I created, some other multi-sided dice, ... Yeah.  I'm a gambling man.
I'm going to clean up this directory when I'm done with my designs (see
Christmas), but for now I'm doing some modifications on the centering of
characters.
